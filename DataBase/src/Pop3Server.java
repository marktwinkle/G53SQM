/*
 * This is the main network section
 * Server.java class is responsible for running the server
 * To run the server, the file is compiled and used in the format: java Server <port number>
 * It opens a server socket for a specific port number (default is 110), and waits for clients to connects
 * It supports multiple clients connections by creating new threads (MultiServerThread.java)
 * This works by opening streams to send and read input and responses
 * The server is responsible for reading a request from a client,then asks CommandInterpreter class for response. The CommandInterpreter will return a response to the server, and then the server redirect it to the client
 * The connection between server and client can be terminated in three ways:
 * 		1. Server Timeout: When the client is not active for SERVER_TIMEOUT time (default is 10 minutes)
 * 		2. Client issuing QUIT command in AUTHORIZATION state
 * 		3. Client issuing QUIT command in UPDATE state 
 * For testing, the 'Client.java' class is created. It connects using the IP and port used for server
 * This method is easy to test multiple connections to server, and verifying multiple creations of CommandInterpreter objects
